        <p class="first_paragraph">T<span class="span_text"> his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was
                travelling. About
                twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too
                great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

        <span class="span_text"> The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg,
            who had the most reason
            of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the
            buffaloes to get out of the way.
            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon
            them.

        <span class="span_text">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession,
            just as if they were not
            impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's
            an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
